Your personal files are encrypted! Encryption was produced using a unique public key RSA-2048 generated for this computer.<br /><br />

To decrypt files you need to obtain the private key.<br /><br />

The single copy of the private key, which will allow to decrypt the files, located on a secret server at the Internet. After that, nobody and never will be able to restore files...<br /><br />

To obtain the private key and php script for this computer, which will automatically decrypt files, you need to pay 0.5 bitcoin(s) (~210 USD).<br />
Without this key, you will never be able to get your original files back.<br /><br /><br />
